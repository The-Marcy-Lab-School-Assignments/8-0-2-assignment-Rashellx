# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
Making an API request from the front end exposes the API key which can cause malicious users to abuse your API key causing data breaches. Making an API request from the server hides your API key by using environmental variables.
