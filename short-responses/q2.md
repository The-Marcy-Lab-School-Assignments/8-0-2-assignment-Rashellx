# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer
Environment variables are hidden variables stored in an .env file. You can store API keys here to avoid showing them to users. You can access them in Node using the dotenv module.
# Teacher Feedback 

This is all true. One small detail is missing and it is that we use process.env.VAR_NAME to access env variables in node.
